# OS_SCHEDULER
Operating-System-Scheduler-and-Memory-Management

This project implements two core components of an operating system: a Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ) scheduler and a Memory Management Unit (MMU). The MLFQ scheduler efficiently manages CPU time among processes by dynamically adjusting their priority based on their behavior and CPU burst characteristics, aiming to improve response time and overall system throughput. The MMU module handles logical-to-physical address translation, ensuring proper memory allocation, protection, and paging mechanisms. Together, these modules simulate how modern operating systems schedule processes and manage memory, providing a hands-on understanding of key OS concepts.
